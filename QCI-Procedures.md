The following proposal intends to implement a new standard for the creation, review, and submission of proposals to QiDao’s governing DAO.

If implemented, all DAO votes will have to follow the following procedures. Community discussions will still take place on QiDao’s Discord.

### What is a QCI?

QCI stands for QiDao Community Idea. The purpose of these proposals is to ensure changes to QiDao are transparent and well governed. A QCI is a document providing information to the QiDao community about a proposed change to the system. The author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions. If a QCI is able to garner enough support to be posted to snapshot it will graduate into a QIP, a Qidao Improvemnt Proposal.

### QCI Process

Parties involved in the process are the author, the editors, QiDao Core Contributors, the QiDao community.

Important notice for authors: before beginning this process, please make sure to vet your idea with the QiDao community. Ask the QiDao community first if an idea is original to avoid wasting time on something that will be rejected based on prior research. It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. The appropriate public forum to gauge interest around your QCI is the QiDao Discord.

Each status change is requested by the author and reviewed by the editors. The editors will process these requests as per the conditions below.

1. Draft - The initial state of a new QCI before it has been assessed
2. Ready for Snapshot - a QCI that is consider ready to be posted to Snaphost and while in this status can not be edited. The author or editors have the option to move the status back to draft to edit it. This status also present the option for any user who meets the Snapshot spaces requirements to be able to post the proposal to Snapshot.
3. Posted to Snapshot/Voting - once a QCI is posted to Snapshot is considered a canonical QIP and as such will be assigned a QIP number upon posting.  During this phase a proposal will be voted on by the Qidao community
4. Approved - a QIP that has successfully reached sufficient support from the DAO via voting
5. Rejected - a QIP that has failed to reach sufficient support from the DAO via voting

New proposals must follow the templates [here](https://github.com/publu/QCIs/tree/main/contents/Templates).

For new draft proposals, please write "To be assigned" for QCI.

Quorum standard for all future votes will be a simple majority of participating votes.

### Editor Responsibilities

For each new proposal that comes in, an editor does the following:

* Read the proposal to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to get to final status.
* The title should accurately describe the content.
* Check the proposal for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), markup (Github-style Markdown), code style
* If the proposal isn't ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.

Once the proposal is ready for the repository, the editor will:

1. Assign proposal number
2. Merge the corresponding pull request
3. Send a message back to the author with the next step

The editors don't pass judgment on proposals. They merely fulfill administrative & editorial duties.
